## Topic
**Purpose:** To analyze confirmed COVID-19 cases, vaccination status and outbreak frequency in Ontario for similarities and patterns. An unsupervised machine learning model that will also be built to cluster Public Health Unit service delivery areas (PHUs) according to case frequency.The output information from our model will provide government with data to create vaccine distribution plans based on patterns of case frequency, vaccination status and outbreak frequency.

**Rationale for Topic Selection:** The importance of having an annual COVID-19 vaccination plan in Ontario has become increasingly apparent as case numbers rise again (as of November 2021). In addition, the need for COVID-19 booster vaccines has recently become a public health and public policy issue. It is clear that COVID-19 will be an ongoing issue in Ontario, Canada, and worldwide.
